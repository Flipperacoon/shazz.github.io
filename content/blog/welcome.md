While I'm waiting for my flight from the pretty high tech and green Arlandia airport in Stockholm, that's a good start to rewind the clock and go back to the 80s. I must admit, at this time, I was at little too young to understand the technical details behind the first digital living organisms created by coders: the first computer viruses.

A few days ago, while discovering the amazing country of my friends from Dead Hackers Society, I was reading a pretty interesting blog article called [Computer Archeology: Exploring the Anatomy of an MS-DOS Virus](https://www.metacodes.pro/blog/computer_archeology_exploring_the_anatomy_of_an_ms_dos_virus/) and it gave me the motivation to so something similar but for the Atari ST.

That's a long time I did not code on any Atari computers, so my 68K skills are pretty rusty but... that should be fine. And to start I tried to find resources on the Atari ST viruses and in fact, except the pretty interesting [STNEWS diskmag UVK book](https://st-news.com/uvk-book/the-book/part-i-the-uvk-book/history-of-viruses-on-atari-tos-computers) from Richard Karsmakers, there is very little resources, some introductions in magazines but that's mostly all.

So this blog may be not be totally useless after all!
